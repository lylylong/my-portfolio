# Yin Long Web Portfolio

## Description

A web Portfolio is important for a designer to showcase his/her design works. It impacts how your client perceives your work. The impression you make on them can either get them to remain on your page and learn about your business or leave your page and turn to a competitor. Good web design helps the designers keep your leads on your page.

As a graphic designer, I realized that I need a web portfolio as well. I checked some good examples and find out what look & feel work for me. Very soon I started working on my web Portfolio.

For this webpage -- LY Portfolio, I spent at least 2 hours to plan the web layout and finish all the coding in 24 hours. The biggest challenge is using the CSS grid to assign the right position for images. I can find the answers by checking my study notes or searching google.
